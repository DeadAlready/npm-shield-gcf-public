# npm-shield-gcf-public

This repository is just a dump of some of the scripts 
I used when collecting data about NPM modules. They were used
to map information about the contents of a module.

It was used with google cloud - gcf, datastore etc.

I apologize in advance about the state of the code. 
Don't have time to correctly package it. As it has been ripped
out of another package and cleared of credentials there probably
are broken references etc.

PS! Keep in mind that these are just simple categorization scripts
and are in no way comprehensive.
